# Checking Lithium Ion Battery Standardization

### Case Illustration:  
You work as a data scientist in a lithium ion battery manufacturing company.The production team asks you to check the battery conditions they produce. One of the things requested is to calculate resistance or resistance and battery power every second.

You are asked to do the task as a data scientist in a Lithium Ion battery manufacturing company.These tasks include:

1. Make two explicit functions to calculate the resistance and battery power.Calculate_resistance () function will calculate the resistance value based on the voltage and current given.The Calculate_power () function will calculate the power value based on the voltage and current given.

2. You are asked to create a new column with the name "R/P" inside the dataset.This column will contain the results of the calculation of power/resistance.If the battery capacity value (capacity) is greater or equal to 2.5, the power value will be calculated.However, if the battery capacity value is less than 2.5, the resistance value will be calculated.To do this, you can use the For and IF Statement.You can also use a list to store temporary calculation results before entering it in the "R/P" column.

3. Finally, you are asked to calculate the average battery capacity value (capacity) for data with a current of 1 ampere (current = 1) and on cycle that has an odd number (for example, cycle 1, 3, 5, etc.).

### RESULT: 

After the experiment, then in checking in the standardization of lithium ion batteries found the results of testing in the Cap column.
In addition, also found the average value of battery capacity with the required conditions found an average value of 2.8064845553927484
